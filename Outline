Project outline: be ready to present in class plus email me a GitHub/GitLab address. For the outline, simply give a sketch of your phylogenetic question and the proposed methods in less than 2 pages. Include a short introduction and the source(s) of data.






Replication of the Gekkotan Phylogenetic Tree

Project Outline
26 March 2019














Introduction
A big component of science lies in repeatability. 
One of the things discussed in class is how the various analyses used can influence or drive the resulting trees. 
As someone who relies on this phylogeny for morphological character evolution, I want to use the most current and comprehensive molecular gekkotan phylogeny and try to recreate it. 
I want to know if using a different tree-building method would have affected the resulting topology. 
Hypothesis: Given the same data and comparable parameters, the three different analyses (Bayesian, Maximum likelihood, and Parsimony) will yield different topological results.
*Ask Dr. Lavrov about the time component “time calibration”
Methods
I would download the data used in the publication from the listed dryad repository (Gamble et al. 2015). 
The publication used 5 nuclear coding genes (RAG1 (1074 bp), RAG2 (366 bp), C-MOS (284 bp), ACM4 (477 bp), PDC (397 bp)) and one mitochondrial fragment (protein coding ND2 gene and associated tRNAs (1414 bp)) from 280 taxa (including 264 gecko species and 16 outgroups).  
I would use the BIC partition scheme, as determined from PartitionFinder v1.0.1 in their work (Lanfear et al. 2012). The three partitions found were: all nuclear gene data, first and second codon positions of the mtDNA dataset plus tRNAs, and third codon positions of the mtDNA dataset plus tRNAs.
I would use the same model of sequence evolution, GTR+G, as determined from PartitionFinder in the publication. 
The original publication was done using BEAST 1.7.4 (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees). I would replicate this analysis using the most recent version of the software (v1.10.4). I would also use an additional Bayesian program, MrBayes, just to see if I would get the same result as with BEAST (Huelsenbeck 2001).
For comparisons of methods, I will also complete a parsimony analysis and a maximum likelihood analysis. The parsimony analysis would be completed using TnT (Tree Analysis using New Technology, Giribet 2005). The maximum likelihood analysis would be completed using RAxML-NG (Koslov et al. 2018). 
Each analysis would be run for 20 million generations, retaining every 5,000th sample, with bootstrap analyses being completed as well. A majority-rule consensus tree would then be used for evaluation. 
Expected Outcomes
The different analyses, parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian, will result in topologies differing, evidenced by the varying measures of support for particular groups. 
The two Bayesian analysis run on different software’s, will result in the most similar trees.
